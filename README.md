4. Go to the **Console** tab and enter:
   ```javascript
   chrome.storage.local.get("authToken", function(data) {
    console.log("Auth Token:", data.authToken);
    });
   ```
5. Copy the ```authToken``` shown in the console and save it for later.

## **Get Your peerPubKey**
6. Extract ```peerPubKey``` 
  ```javascript
  chrome.storage.local.get("nodeData", function(data) {
    console.log("Node Data:", data.nodeData);
});
```
This will print something like:
```javascript
{
  "peerEncryptedPrivKey": "m9+YyMXk7N1daxSR...",
  "peerPubKey": "12D................................2bk"
}
```
7. Save the ```authToken``` and ```peerPubKey``` these are essential for the Python script.

## **Multiple Nodes**
1. You can remove the extension after obtaining its ```peerPubKey``` and download it again to get a new one.
2. Repeat this process as many times as you like.
3. There is a cap of 5 devices so no need to go all out.

## **Requirements**
- **Python**: Install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or use the command below for Ubuntu:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install python3
  ```
- **VPS Server**: Use AWS, Google Cloud, or any cheap VPS (~$2-5/month).
